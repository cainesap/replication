# Overview
- define R Markdown
- using R Markdown
- relevance to Replication


# What is R Markdown?
- source file / output file paradigm (cp LaTeX, HTML, markdown)
- plain text file (.Rmd), rendered by R
- markdown = plain-text authoring syntax, increasingly popular (e.g. GitHub)
- R Markdown = implementation of markdown, can process output from R
- uses `knitr` package (successor to `Sweave`) and 'Pandoc' text file conversion program
- can produce HTML, PDF and Word documents

# What is R Markdown?
- **simple syntax**: shallow learning curve
- **human-readable**: emphasis on communication and clarity, rather than technique and complexity
- **transparent formatting**: wysiwyg
- **embedded computation**: share with collaborators, reviewers, colleagues, students, critics


# What is R Markdown?
>  ... integrating source code, statistical output, and text in R Markdown is **a model of reproducibility**.

> Such transparency facilitates comprehension, defensibility, and further research or testing.

> R Markdown helps to bring the vision for reproducibility in statistical analysis articulated by Gentleman & Temple Lang [2004] to reality.

# What is R Markdown?
> This vision — in which the barriers to verify another’s statistical computations from start to finish are low — is the intellectual descendant of Claerbout [1994], Buckheit & Donoho [1995], and began with Knuth [1984], the creator of TEX.

> Moreover, R Markdown is dynamic: each time the document is rendered, the commands therein are run anew. If data are altered or different data are called in advance of rendering, then the output is dependent and calculated accordingly.
